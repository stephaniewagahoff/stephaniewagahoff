I have recently taken an interest in world of coding. It is something I had thought about in the past but hadn't put effort into it. After taking two assements/tests this past summer, I passed both. Ultimately, I became intrigued. Those tests have led me to where I am now in the Promineo Tech Bootcamp. Every time I conquer the next step, my passion grows more.  I am looking forward to what the furture holds in software development.
